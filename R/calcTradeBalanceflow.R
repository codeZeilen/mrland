#' Calculate global under-/overproduction
#' 
#' Calculate the difference between the global production and the global
#' domestic_supply. The difference is the result of imports not equaling
#' exports, and because storage is not considered. The calculated
#' DomesticBalanceflow assures that production matches domestic_supply. The
#' goods come from nowhere and go to nowhere. The numbers are usually decreased
#' linearly and become zero in 2050.
